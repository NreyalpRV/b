    <p> Before we start, I would like to greet you a blessed and joyous birthday, my dear friend Mercy. Actually, I don't have anything to say at the moment. Wala akong maisip and my mind is blank. You may think that I was trying my best to make an effort just to please you and you might find it insincere--which is, I find it somewhat true. But one thing is for sure, greeting you is something I want to do. I won't fikter my words and what I'm about to say is my honest feelings. I just find it unfair for you guys to always greet me and I don't even know your birthdays. Just think of it as a compensation for my selfishness and for being self-centered. Sorry kung wala akong regalong maibibigay or hindi ako makakadalo sa handaan--if ever meron. I'm sorry if I can't give you a hug or a kiss on the cheeks--if you don't mind. I'm sorry I can't greet you in person. I'm sorry that all I can give you is this message.

Speaking of sorry, I want to apologize for my behavior in the past. Alam ko na makasarili ako, manggagamit at plastik. I was influenced by the world. Wrong, I let the world influenced me. You see, when I was 10 years old my family broke apart. Nagkawatak watak kami. Nagkahiwawalay ng landas. As a kid, I was unable to grasp the situation. All I know is that we are not happy anymore. As a child who don't understand anything, I started believing things that in my favor. Kinakampihan ko ang isa kong parents dahil their on my side at sinisiraan ang isa. I was a horrible person. Growing up without a proper guidance took a toll on my mental state. Without any parents to guide me I became a rebel. At narealize ko, I don't really want to destroy my life. All I want is my family back. Since nasa side ako ni mama those last 3 years, gusto ko kuhain ang atensiyon niya. Because I need it. Because I was a mess. Naging grade conscious ako. Ginagawa ko lahat para lang makapasok ako sa top. Para mapraise ako ni mama pero in the end, wala rin. Wala siyang paki. You see, even when my family was still whole, before it broke a part, I was a loner in my previous school. Lagi akong mag isa. Walang kaibigan. Kaya okay lang sakin na masira image ko sa iba, kahit ano pang sabihin nila wala akong paki, kaya nabubuhos ko lahat ng oras ko sa pag-aaral. Kaya kaya kong maging masama, kaya kaya ko maging salbahi. Masyado akong focus sa greed ko na hindi ko namamalayan nakakasakit na ako ng tao. I'm not making an excuse, I know that the pain my words has cause will never be erase. And nothing can justify what I did wrong, but I want to say that I am deeply sorry for the bottom of my heart.

Let's move on to the thank you's. Masyado kasing naging seryoso iyong pangalawang paragraph HAHAHA. Sorry na. These thank you's are for the things you did that move my heart. One of them is your humbleness. I adore how your achievements never get to your head. Kahit na successful kana hindi mo nakakalimutan iyong mga bagay or tao na tumulong sayo umangat. To be honest, I envy you. I know to myself I'm not kind. I'm the epitome of evil. I tend forget the things and people that help me. I always focus on relief and not the pain. But you, you endure all the pain and use it to grow. That's why you deserve success. That's why I always envy those kind of people. The other one is your independence. This is one of the things I envy and adore about you. You are so confident standing on your own in front of the fearful crowd. You're the kind of person that no one can be tainted. I am proud of you. Lastly, your kindness. This is the character I envy the most. Sa mga nababasa ko na manga, napapanood na anime or nababasa sa libro, the kind ones are dazzling. Their kindness influence and change others. At ang pinakakinaiinggitan ko ay, maganda ang kapalit sa kabutihan nila. Be good and good things will happened. That is somethin I can never achieve, a character I can never have. That's why, shine brightly. Blind them with your kindness. Continue influencing others and change them for the better. After all, I want you to be happy. Again let me greet you a flashing, blessed nad Joyous happy birthday. Astra per aspera! May the odds will ever be in your favor. Godbless you, Mercy Grace. Thank you for being part of my Journey. Lovelots~❤️. </p>
